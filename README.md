# AT-POMDP

The Assistive Tutor POMDP (AT-POMDP) developed by Aditi Ramachandran and Sarah Strohkorb Sebo, was designed to select appropriate tutoring actions to support 5th grade students in a one-on-one tutoring interaction with a Nao robot on the topic of long-division mathemtaics. 

If you are using this software or one of its components, we recommend that you cite the paper in which we present the AT-POMDP and its evaluation with 5th grade students:
